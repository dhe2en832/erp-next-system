RESTART YOUR NEXT.JS DEVELOPMENT SERVER!

The API route file has been updated with clean code.
The 417 "undefined: undefined" error should now be resolved.

Steps:
1. Stop your current Next.js dev server (Ctrl+C)
2. Run: npm run dev
3. Try submitting the delivery note again

Expected result: You should now see the actual ERPNext error message
instead of "undefined: undefined".
